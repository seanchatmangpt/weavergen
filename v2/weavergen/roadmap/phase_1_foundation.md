# Phase 1: Foundational Weavergen Architecture (Completed)

This phase established the core, declarative architecture of Weavergen, enabling automated code generation and basic observability through a "convention over configuration" approach.

### Key Achievements:

-   **✅ Weaver Forge Integration via Python Wrapper:**
    -   Established a robust Python wrapper (`weavergen.cli_wrapper` and `weavergen.generator`) that orchestrates the Weaver Rust CLI.
    -   Leveraged `weaver-forge.yaml` as the single source of truth for all code generation parameters, filters, and template mappings, eliminating manual CLI flags.
    -   Ensured seamless execution of Weaver Forge commands from Python, adhering to the CLI-first philosophy.

-   **✅ Spec-Driven Pydantic Model Generation:**
    -   Implemented the generation of type-safe Pydantic models directly from OpenTelemetry semantic conventions (`semconv_grouped_attributes` filter) and custom CLI/BPMN specifications.
    -   These models provide robust data validation and clean interfaces across all generated components, ensuring data integrity from input to output.

-   **✅ CLI-First Orchestration API:**
    -   Developed the `weavergen` CLI as the primary interface for all operations, with commands designed to trigger BPMN workflows.
    -   The CLI itself is generated (or scaffolded) using Typer, demonstrating the "dogfooding" principle of our own code generation capabilities.

-   **✅ Basic OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Generation:**
    -   Integrated the generation of foundational OpenTelemetry components (TracerProvider, basic exporters) via `instrumentation.j2`.
    -   Ensured that generated code includes basic span creation and attribute setting, laying the groundwork for comprehensive observability.

-   **✅ BPMN-First Workflow Enablement:**
    -   Established the capability to define and execute workflows using BPMN files, with generated Python stubs for service tasks.
    -   This foundational step enables visual workflow orchestration and separates business logic from code generation concerns.
