This Python file, `bpmn_process_miner.py`, implements process mining capabilities for WeaverGen.
It analyzes execution spans (traces) to automatically discover and generate optimized BPMN workflows.
The `BPMNProcessMiner` class provides the core functionality:
1. `mine_workflow`: Takes a list of OpenTelemetry spans and reconstructs a `DiscoveredWorkflow` object.
   - It builds a process graph (`_build_process_graph`) by grouping spans by trace and identifying sequential relationships between tasks.
   - It identifies start and end tasks within the workflow.
   - It discovers various process patterns (`_discover_patterns`), including sequences, parallel executions, choices (XOR gateways), and loops.
   - It calculates quality metrics (`_calculate_quality_metrics`) for the discovered workflow, such as completeness, precision, fitness, and simplicity.
2. `generate_bpmn`: Converts a `DiscoveredWorkflow` object into a BPMN XML file.
   - It creates BPMN elements (start events, service tasks, end events, sequence flows, parallel gateways) based on the discovered nodes and patterns.
   - It includes task documentation with mining metadata (frequency, duration, quality score).
3. `patterns_to_bpmn`: Generates executable BPMN from discovered patterns, including handling of parallel gateways and conditional flows.
Helper methods like `_sanitize_id` ensure valid BPMN IDs.
The module uses `rich` for console output and `xml.etree.ElementTree` for XML manipulation.
This process mining capability allows WeaverGen to automatically infer and visualize business processes from system execution data, enabling deeper analysis and optimization.
