This Python file defines CLI commands for a DMEDI-based system regeneration process.
It uses `typer` for CLI interface and `rich` for rich terminal output.
Asynchronous operations are handled with `asyncio`.
The `WeaverGenV2Engine` is used to execute BPMN workflows.
The `define` command creates a regeneration charter, specifying system components, dependencies, health thresholds, and max regeneration time.
The `measure` command assesses system entropy and regeneration needs, displaying results in various formats (rich, JSON, Mermaid).
The `explore` command generates and evaluates regeneration options based on charter and entropy measurements.
The `execute` command performs the complete DMEDI regeneration cycle, with options for dry run, force, and confirmation.
The `auto` command executes an automatic DMEDI regeneration cycle with intelligent decision-making based on entropy thresholds.
The `status` command shows the current regeneration status and system health, with detailed options.
Display functions are provided for charter summaries, entropy results, regeneration options, execution results, and auto-regeneration results.
The file acts as a command-line interface to orchestrate complex regeneration workflows via a BPMN engine.
