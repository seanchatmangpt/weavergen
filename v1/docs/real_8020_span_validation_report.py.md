This Python file, `real_8020_span_validation_report.py`, generates a "REAL 80/20 SPAN VALIDATION REPORT".
Its purpose is to provide definitive proof that the claimed 80/20 performance improvements in WeaverGen are real and measurable, based on OpenTelemetry span data.
The script loads span data from `real_8020_execution_spans.json`.
It identifies and compares "baseline" and "final" performance measurements captured as spans, calculating the overall improvement in completion rate.
It then iterates through various "individual 80/20 improvements" (e.g., parallel execution, fast validation, resource scaling, work prioritization, self-healing).
For each improvement, it extracts specific metrics and attributes from corresponding spans, such as speedup factors, rate boosts, and recovery rates.
It prints detailed information for each improvement, including the span ID, duration, and the measured impact.
The script calculates the cumulative improvement and compares it against the measured final improvement to assess validation accuracy.
Finally, it generates a `8020_validation_certificate.json` file, which serves as a formal record of the validation, including metadata, trace ID, and a summary of individual improvements with their span evidence.
This file is crucial for demonstrating the tangible benefits of WeaverGen's optimized architecture through empirical, span-based evidence.
