This Python file defines auto-generated Pydantic models.
It includes two models: `AgentInteraction` and `ValidationResult`.
`AgentInteraction` models an interaction between agents, capturing `agent_id`, `role`, `message_content`, `structured_output` status, and a `timestamp`.
`ValidationResult` models the outcome of a validation process, including `component_id`, `validation_passed` status, a `quality_score` (between 0.0 and 1.0), and a list of `issues`.
These models are likely used for structured data exchange and validation within a system that involves AI agents and automated processes, such as semantic analysis and code generation.
