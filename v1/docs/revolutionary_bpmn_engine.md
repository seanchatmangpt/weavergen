### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/src/weavergen/revolutionary_bpmn_engine.py`

*   **Purpose:** This module implements a "Revolutionary BPMN Engine" with advanced AI-native capabilities. It aims to create BPMN workflows that can generate themselves from natural language, predict execution outcomes, self-optimize based on results, and even auto-heal when errors occur. It leverages `pydantic-ai` and LLMs (Ollama/OpenAI) for these intelligent functionalities. It extends `UnifiedBPMNEngine` and defines classes for `NaturalLanguageToBPMN`, `WorkflowPredictor`, `WorkflowOptimizer`, and `SelfHealingWorkflow`.
*   **Relevance to `GEMINI.md`:** The `GEMINI.md` highlights "BPMN Workflow Engine," "Multi-agent system operations," and "AI Agents" as core features, emphasizing the project's vision for AI-driven automation and self-improving systems. This file directly implements a highly ambitious and innovative aspect of that vision. It represents the cutting edge of the project's AI integration, going beyond simple code generation to intelligent workflow management.
*   **Value:** This is a **critical, advanced component** that embodies the "ultrathink vision" mentioned in the `GEMINI.md`. It showcases the project's ambition to create self-generating, self-healing, and self-optimizing BPMN workflows. While some parts might be conceptual or simulated in this version, it represents a significant leap in AI-native architecture and is central to the project's long-term goals.

*   **Category:** Core Component / Advanced AI-Native Architecture.
*   **Reasoning:** This file implements the "revolutionary" AI-native BPMN engine, which is a key differentiator and a central part of WeaverGen's advanced vision for self-generating, self-healing, and self-optimizing workflows.
