This Python file contains auto-generated Pydantic AI agents.
It defines four agent classes: `AnalystAgent`, `CoordinatorAgent`, `ValidatorAgent`, and `FacilitatorAgent`.
Each agent is configured with a mock `gpt-4o-mini` model and a system prompt defining its specialized role.
Agents possess `role` and `capabilities` attributes, outlining their function within the system.
Each agent implements an asynchronous `process` method that simulates data processing and returns a structured output, including a `quality_score`.
This file is a component of a larger system where AI agents are dynamically generated to perform specific tasks in semantic analysis and code generation workflows.
