This file contains auto-generated Pydantic AI agents, specifically designed for semantic analysis and code generation. It defines four distinct agent classes:

- **`AnalystAgent`**: Specializes in semantic analysis and code generation, performing analytical tasks.
- **`CoordinatorAgent`**: Focuses on semantic analysis and code generation, acting as a coordinator.
- **`ValidatorAgent`**: Dedicated to semantic analysis and code generation, responsible for validation.
- **`FacilitatorAgent`**: Specializes in semantic analysis and code generation, facilitating processes.

Each agent class:
- Inherits from `pydantic_ai.Agent`.
- Is initialized with a mock `gpt-4o-mini` model and a specific system prompt defining its role and expertise.
- Includes an asynchronous `process` method that takes a dictionary as input and returns a dictionary containing processed data, the agent's role, and a quality score.

These agents are designed to provide structured output and perform validation within their respective domains.
