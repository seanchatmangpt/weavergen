This Python file, `weavergen_8020_gap_filler.py`, is a core component of WeaverGen, designed to implement the "80/20 rule" by filling critical gaps that deliver 80% of the semantic convention functionality.
It explicitly states that it uses span-based validation and no Pytests or unit tests.
The `WeaverGen8020` class orchestrates the gap-filling process.
It identifies and implements five critical gaps:
1. **Semantic Convention Parser**: Implements `src/weavergen/semantic_parser.py` for parsing YAML/JSON semantic conventions.
2. **Template Engine Integration**: Implements `src/weavergen/template_engine.py` for generating code using Jinja2 templates (Pydantic models, validators, CLI commands).
3. **4-Layer Architecture Connection**: Implements `src/weavergen/layers/semantic_contracts.py` and `src/weavergen/layers/semantic_runtime.py` to connect the contracts and runtime layers for semantic convention processing.
4. **CLI Command Implementation**: Implements `src/weavergen/semantic_cli.py` to provide CLI commands for semantic convention generation and validation.
5. **Span-Based Validation**: Implements `src/weavergen/span_validation.py` for comprehensive validation using OpenTelemetry spans.
Each gap implementation involves writing Python code to specific files and recording detailed OpenTelemetry spans to track progress and attributes.
The `_start_span` and `_end_span` methods are used to create and manage these spans, capturing `span_id`, `trace_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration_ms`, and custom attributes.
After filling the gaps, it generates a sample `test_agent.yaml` semantic convention file.
The `main` function executes the gap-filling process, prints a summary, and saves all captured spans to `weavergen_8020_spans.json`.
This file is central to WeaverGen's development philosophy, demonstrating a rapid, value-driven implementation approach validated by observable runtime behavior.
