This Python file implements a Six Sigma DMEDI (Define, Measure, Explore, Develop, Implement) Training System with integration for the `qwen3` LLM (via Ollama and Pydantic AI).
It adheres to WeaverGen's patterns for instrumentation and structured output.
Key components include:
- **Semantic Spans and AI Validation Decorators**: `@semantic_span` and `@ai_validation` are used for OpenTelemetry instrumentation and AI output validation, respectively.
- **Core Models**: Pydantic models (`SixSigmaTrainingSession`, `ProjectCharter`, `VOCAnalysis`, `TRIZSolution`, `DOEDesign`, `ImplementationPlan`) define structured outputs for various DMEDI artifacts.
- **`SixSigmaQwen3Agent`**: A base class for Six Sigma agents, integrating with `qwen3` via `OpenAIModel` and `OpenAIProvider` (configured for Ollama).
- **Phase-Specific Instructors**: `DefinePhaseQwen3Instructor`, `MeasurePhaseQwen3Instructor`, `ExplorePhaseQwen3Instructor`, `DevelopPhaseQwen3Instructor`, and `ImplementPhaseQwen3Instructor` are specialized agents for each DMEDI phase.
  - These instructors generate phase-specific outputs (e.g., project charters, VOC analyses, TRIZ solutions, DOE designs, implementation plans) using the `qwen3` model.
  - They include methods for assessing the quality of generated artifacts.
- **`SixSigmaQwen3TrainingOrchestrator`**: Coordinates the training process, routing requests to the appropriate phase instructor.
- **Demo Function (`demo_six_sigma_qwen3_training`)**: Showcases the system's capabilities, including training session creation, qwen3-powered content generation, and progress assessment.
This system demonstrates a sophisticated application of AI agents for structured training and process improvement within a Six Sigma framework, leveraging OpenTelemetry for observability and Pydantic for data integrity.
