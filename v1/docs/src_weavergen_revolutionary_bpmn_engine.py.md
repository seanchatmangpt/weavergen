This Python file implements a Revolutionary BPMN Engine with AI-native capabilities.
It enables natural language to BPMN generation, predictive execution, self-optimization, and auto-healing of workflows.
The `NaturalLanguageToBPMN` class generates BPMN workflows from natural language descriptions, leveraging an AI agent.
`WorkflowPredictor` forecasts workflow execution outcomes, including success probability and potential issues.
`WorkflowOptimizer` suggests improvements based on execution results to enhance performance and reliability.
`SelfHealingWorkflow` automatically analyzes and attempts to fix failed workflows.
The engine integrates with `UnifiedBPMNEngine` for core BPMN execution.
It uses `pydantic-ai` for AI agent interactions and `opentelemetry` for tracing.
Key concepts include AI-driven workflow design, predictive analytics for execution, and autonomous error recovery.
This system embodies an "ultrathink vision" where BPMN workflows are self-generating, self-healing, and evolving through AI.
