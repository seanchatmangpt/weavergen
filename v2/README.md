A: Copilot is autocomplete. v2 is intelligence - multi-model reasoning, continuous learning, and predictive generation.

**Q: How do you ensure quality?**
A: Same as v1 - span-based validation. Every AI decision is backed by execution evidence, not just unit tests.

**Q: What's the business opportunity?**
A: First intelligent code generation platform. $25B market opportunity with 40% YoY growth.
