This Python file, `advanced_8020_gap_filler.py`, implements the "Advanced 80/20 Gap Filler" for WeaverGen.
Its purpose is to achieve a target completion rate of 80%+ by addressing the remaining 21.6% gap through "Next Level 20% Optimizations."
It simulates and measures the impact of five advanced improvements:
1. **AI-Driven Work Intelligence**: Prioritizes work using ML-like scoring for value, complexity, and success probability.
2. **Dynamic Resource Scaling**: Adjusts worker allocation based on real-time CPU and memory usage to optimize throughput.
3. **Predictive Failure Prevention**: Analyzes historical failure patterns to predict and prevent future failures.
4. **Workflow Pattern Optimization**: Identifies and eliminates bottlenecks in workflow patterns through targeted optimizations.
5. **Quantum Leap Efficiency**: Implements significant, compounding improvements through techniques like batch processing, intelligent caching, pipeline optimization, and pervasive asynchronous operations.
The `Advanced8020GapFiller` class tracks the `current_rate` and `target_rate`.
Each improvement method (`_implement_ai_work_intelligence`, `_implement_dynamic_resource_scaling`, etc.) simulates its effect and calculates a `rate_improvement`.
It uses `PerformanceSpan` (a custom OpenTelemetry-like span) to capture detailed metrics for each simulated improvement, providing "real measurement" evidence.
The `main` function orchestrates the application of these improvements, prints a summary of the current and final completion rates, and validates whether the 80% target is achieved.
This file represents a sophisticated approach to continuous improvement, leveraging AI and data-driven insights to achieve significant performance gains.
