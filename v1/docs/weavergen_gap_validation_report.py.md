This Python file generates a "WEAVERGEN 80/20 GAP VALIDATION REPORT".
It validates the implementation of key functionalities (gaps) in WeaverGen using OpenTelemetry span evidence, explicitly stating that no unit tests are used.
The validation process involves loading span data from `weavergen_8020_spans.json`.
It defines a list of `gaps` to be validated, each with a `name`, `span_name`, `expected_value` (percentage), and `expected_file`.
For each gap, it checks if the corresponding span exists and if its attributes match the expected values.
It verifies the existence of implemented files (e.g., `semantic_parser.py`, `template_engine.py`, `semantic_contracts.py`, `semantic_cli.py`, `span_validation.py`).
It performs functional verification by attempting to import and use components like `SemanticConventionParser` and `WeaverGenTemplateEngine`.
The report summarizes the validation results, including the number of validated gaps, total value percentage, and implementation success.
Finally, it generates a `weavergen_8020_certificate.json` file containing validation metadata and a unique certificate ID.
This script serves as a critical component for ensuring that the 80/20 implementation strategy has successfully filled the identified gaps, with verifiable evidence from runtime spans.
