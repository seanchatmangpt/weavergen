This file contains auto-generated Pydantic AI agents designed for semantic analysis and code generation within a Six Sigma context.

It defines four distinct agent classes:

- **`CoordinatorAgent`**: Specializes in semantic analysis and code generation, acting as a coordinator.
- **`AnalystAgent`**: Focuses on semantic analysis and code generation, performing analytical tasks.
- **`FacilitatorAgent`**: Specializes in semantic analysis and code generation, facilitating processes.
- **`ValidatorAgent`**: Dedicated to semantic analysis and code generation, responsible for validation.

Each agent class:
- Inherits from `pydantic_ai.Agent`.
- Is initialized with a mock `gpt-4o-mini` model and a specific system prompt defining its role and expertise.
- Includes a `process` asynchronous method that takes a dictionary as input and returns a dictionary containing processed data, the agent's role, and a quality score.

The agents are designed to provide structured output and perform validation within their respective domains.
