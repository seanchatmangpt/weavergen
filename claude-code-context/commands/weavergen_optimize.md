# WeaverGen Performance Optimization

Optimize generation performance through intelligent caching, parallel processing, and 26x efficiency improvements.

## Instructions

1. **Performance Analysis**
   - Analyze current generation pipeline performance metrics
   - Identify bottlenecks in registry parsing, template processing, and code generation
   - Measure token efficiency and SPR compression ratios
   - Benchmark against 26x performance optimization targets

2. **Optimization Implementation**
   - Deploy intelligent caching strategies for semantic convention patterns
   - Configure parallel processing for multi-language generation workflows
   - Optimize template compilation and reuse across generation cycles
   - Implement predictive preloading for commonly used conventions

3. **Automation Enhancement**
   - Setup autonomous optimization loops for continuous improvement
   - Configure self-healing mechanisms for performance degradation detection
   - Implement evolution tracking for >20% improvement identification
   - Deploy compound impact measurement for ROI validation

4. **Results Validation**
   - Measure performance improvements against baseline metrics
   - Validate code quality maintenance during optimization
   - Test generation accuracy and compliance preservation
   - Update session context with optimization results and recommendations
