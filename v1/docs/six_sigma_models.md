### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/src/weavergen/six_sigma_models.py`

*   **Purpose:** This module defines a comprehensive set of Pydantic models for the Design for Lean Six Sigma (DMEDI) methodology. It covers all phases (Define, Measure, Explore, Develop, Implement) with detailed models for concepts like `ProjectCharter`, `VOCAnalysis`, `DOEDesign`, `ControlPlan`, and a `DMEDICapstoneProject` to encapsulate the entire process. These models provide type-safe data structures for managing Six Sigma projects.
*   **Relevance to `GEMINI.md`:** The `GEMINI.md` states that `src/weavergen/models.py` is where "Pydantic models for configuration and results" are located. This `six_sigma_models.py` file is a prime example of domain-specific Pydantic models that would be used within the WeaverGen ecosystem, particularly for the Six Sigma AI agents. It demonstrates the project's capability to model complex business processes using structured data.
*   **Value:** This is a **core data model component**. It provides the structured data foundation for the Six Sigma AI agents and any related BPMN workflows or analytics. Its comprehensive nature for the DMEDI methodology makes it a valuable asset for any Six Sigma-related functionality within WeaverGen.

*   **Category:** Core Component / Domain-Specific Data Models.
*   **Reasoning:** Defines comprehensive Pydantic models for the Six Sigma DMEDI methodology, serving as the data foundation for related AI agents and workflows within WeaverGen.
