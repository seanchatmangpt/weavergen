This module implements the "Active Intelligence Orchestrator," designed to bridge the performance gap from a 39% to an 80%+ completion rate by applying intelligent 80/20 principles. It focuses on autonomous performance improvement through intelligent work prioritization and parallel execution.

Key components and functionalities:

- **`WorkIntelligence` Dataclass**: Stores intelligence about work items, including value score, complexity, dependencies, estimated time, success probability, and parallel eligibility.
- **`SystemHealth` Dataclass**: Tracks real-time system health metrics such as active processes, completion rate, average response time, memory usage, and CPU utilization.
- **`ActiveIntelligenceOrchestrator` Class**: The core orchestrator that manages and applies the 80/20 improvements:
    1.  **Intelligent Work Analyzer (`_intelligent_work_analyzer`)**: Continuously analyzes and prioritizes work items based on their value, complexity, and dependencies.
    2.  **Parallel Execution Engine (`_parallel_execution_engine`)**: Executes high-value, independent work items in parallel using a process pool, prioritizing based on a value-to-complexity ratio.
    3.  **Self-Healing Monitor (`_self_healing_monitor`)**: Monitors system health and automatically detects and heals failures (e.g., low completion rates, high response times) by restarting stalled processes, unblocking work, or adjusting worker counts.
    4.  **Continuous Optimizer (`_continuous_optimizer`)**: Collects performance metrics and continuously optimizes the system based on trends, adjusting value thresholds and worker counts to maximize improvement.
    5.  **Reality Validator (`_reality_validator`)**: Performs fast, non-blocking validation of the system's real-time status, including active processes and completion rates.

- **Helper Methods**: A suite of helper methods (`_load_work_items`, `_get_executable_work`, `_execute_work_item`, `_mark_completed`, `_mark_failed`, `_check_system_health`, `_count_completed_work`, `_count_total_work`, `_get_completed_ids`, `_unblock_stalled_work`, `_adjust_value_thresholds`, `_calculate_optimal_workers`) support the core orchestration logic by interacting with a mock coordination system (e.g., `work_claims.json` and `coordination_helper.sh`).
- **`main` function**: Runs the active intelligence orchestrator, demonstrating its ability to fill the performance gap and providing a final performance report upon interruption.

The module heavily utilizes `asyncio` for concurrent operations, `multiprocessing` for parallel execution, `json` for data handling, and `subprocess` for interacting with external system components.
