This Python file, `test_pm4py_integration.py`, is a comprehensive test suite for the process mining capabilities within WeaverGen, specifically focusing on its integration with the PM4Py library.
It demonstrates and verifies several key functionalities:
1. **XES Conversion**: Tests the conversion of OpenTelemetry spans (loaded from a JSON file) into the XES format using `XESConverter`.
2. **Process Mining**: Utilizes `BPMNProcessMiner` to mine workflow patterns from collected spans, including the discovery of process nodes and patterns (sequences, parallels).
3. **BPMN Generation**: Verifies the ability to generate BPMN XML files from the discovered process patterns.
4. **CLI Commands**: Checks for the availability of new CLI commands related to process mining (e.g., `spans-to-xes`, `analyze-xes`, `mine-patterns`, `adaptive-demo`).
5. **PM4Py Features**: If PM4Py is installed, it performs additional tests using PM4Py's native functionalities, such as XES analysis and process model generation (Petri nets, process trees, DFG).
The script uses `rich` for enhanced console output, providing clear visual feedback on test progress and results.
It includes a mechanism to handle cases where PM4Py might not be installed, falling back to manual XES export/analysis.
This test file is crucial for ensuring the robustness and correctness of WeaverGen's process mining features, which enable users to gain insights into their workflows from execution data.
