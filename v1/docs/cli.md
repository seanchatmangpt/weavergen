### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/src/weavergen/cli.py`

*   **Purpose:** This is the main command-line interface (CLI) for WeaverGen, built using `typer`. It orchestrates various functionalities, including code generation (`generate`), semantic validation (`validate`), template management (`templates`), configuration (`config`), and more advanced features like `forge_generate`, `forge_to_agents`, `full_pipeline`, agent communication, conversation management, benchmarking, and debugging. It integrates with `WeaverGen` core, `spiff_integration`, `forge_generator`, and `cli_dod_enforcer`.
*   **Relevance to `GEMINI.md`:** This file is *the* central piece of the current `weavergen` architecture as described in `GEMINI.md`. The `GEMINI.md` explicitly states: "CLI Layer (`src/weavergen/cli.py`) - Typer-based CLI... Commands trigger BPMN workflows: `generate`, `validate`, `templates`, `config`... Entry point: `weavergen` command (workflow orchestrator)... NO direct function calls - ALL commands execute .bpmn workflows." This file directly implements that description, serving as the primary user interface and orchestrator for the entire system.
*   **Value:** This is a **critical, core component** of the WeaverGen project. It is the primary entry point for users and the orchestrator of the entire system's functionality, including the BPMN workflows and AI agent integrations. Its presence and design are central to the project's current philosophy and operation.

*   **Category:** Core Component / Main CLI.
*   **Reasoning:** This file is the central command-line interface for WeaverGen, directly implementing the "CLI Layer" described in `GEMINI.md`. It serves as the primary user entry point and orchestrates all major functionalities, including BPMN workflows and AI agent integrations.
