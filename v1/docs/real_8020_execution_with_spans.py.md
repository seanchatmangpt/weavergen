This Python file, `real_8020_execution_with_spans.py`, is designed to provide real, measurable evidence of performance improvements in WeaverGen, adhering to the 80/20 rule.
It explicitly states that it uses OpenTelemetry spans for capturing actual performance data, rather than synthetic demonstrations.
The `Real8020ExecutionEngine` class orchestrates the execution and measurement of various improvements:
- **Baseline Performance Measurement**: Establishes a baseline completion rate and execution time for a set of simulated work items.
- **Parallel Execution**: Demonstrates and measures the speedup achieved by executing tasks in parallel using `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- **Fast Validation**: Compares the performance of a "slow" comprehensive validation with an "optimized" fast validation.
- **Resource Scaling**: Measures the impact of resource allocation on performance by simulating tasks with varying numbers of workers and analyzing CPU/memory usage.
- **Work Prioritization**: Shows the efficiency gains from prioritizing work items based on their value.
- **Self-Healing**: Simulates various failure types and measures the system's recovery rate.
For each improvement, it records detailed OpenTelemetry-like spans (`PerformanceSpan` dataclass) that capture start/end times, durations, and specific attributes related to the improvement (e.g., speedup factors, completion rates, resource usage).
Finally, it measures the overall final performance after all improvements are applied and generates a comprehensive span report (`real_8020_execution_spans.json`).
This script is crucial for empirically validating the performance claims of WeaverGen's optimized architecture.
