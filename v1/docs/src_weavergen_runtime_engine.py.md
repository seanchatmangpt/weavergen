This Python file defines the WeaverGen Runtime Engine, focusing on an 80/20 implementation strategy and relying solely on span-based validation, explicitly avoiding Pytests.
`WeaverRuntime` is the core execution runtime, managing generation, validation, and template operations.
It handles `execute_generation` for semantic convention code generation, parsing requests into `GenerationConfig`.
`execute_validation` performs syntax and pipeline validation using the `SpanBasedValidator`.
`execute_template_operation` manages template listing and basic rendering.
`TemplateEngine` is responsible for rendering templates, including a simple caching mechanism.
`ProcessManager` executes external `weaver` commands using `subprocess`, handling timeouts and errors.
All key operations within these classes are instrumented with OpenTelemetry spans for detailed tracing and analysis.
The module includes `validate_runtime_integration` to test the integration of these components, saving execution telemetry and validation spans.
It emphasizes a practical approach to system development and validation, prioritizing observable runtime behavior over traditional unit tests.
