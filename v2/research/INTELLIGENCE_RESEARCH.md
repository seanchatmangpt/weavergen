# WeaverGen v2: Intelligence Research
*Research Foundation for Intelligent Code Generation*

## Research Thesis

**Central Question**: How do we build AI systems that generate code more intelligently than humans, with provable continuous improvement?

**Key Insight from v1**: Spans don't lie - execution telemetry provides ground truth that summaries cannot.

**v2 Research Goal**: Extend this principle to AI decision-making - every intelligent decision must be backed by measurable evidence.

## Core Research Areas

## 🧠 1. Multi-Model Consensus Intelligence

### Research Question
How can we orchestrate multiple AI models to make better decisions than any single model?

### Current State of Art
- **Ensemble Methods**: Traditional ML ensemble techniques
- **Model Routing**: Route queries to best-performing model
- **Majority Voting**: Simple consensus mechanisms
- **Mixture of Experts**: Specialized models for specific tasks

### Research Gaps
- **Context-Aware Consensus**: Models should agree based on context understanding
- **Quality Prediction**: Predict output quality before generation
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Real-time model selection based on task complexity
- **Feedback-Driven Improvement**: Use execution results to improve consensus

### Proposed Innovations

    def __init__(self):
        self.semantic_similarity = SemanticSimilarityEngine()
        self.quality_predictor = QualityPredictor()
        self.confidence_estimator = ConfidenceEstimator()
    
    async def achieve_consensus(self, model_outputs: List[ModelOutput]) -> ConsensusResult:
        """Achieve consensus based on semantic similarity and confidence"""
        
        # 1. Semantic clustering of outputs
        clusters = await self.semantic_similarity.cluster(model_outputs)
        
        # 2. Quality prediction for each cluster
        quality_scores = await self.quality_predictor.score_clusters(clusters)
