This Python file defines two Pydantic models: `AgentInteraction` and `ValidationResult`. The `AgentInteraction` model captures details of interactions between agents, including agent ID, role, message content, whether the output is structured, and a timestamp. The `ValidationResult` model stores the outcome of a validation process, specifying the component ID, a boolean indicating if validation passed, a quality score (between 0.0 and 1.0), and a list of any issues found. Both models utilize Pydantic's `Field` for detailed descriptions and validation constraints, such as `ge` (greater than or equal to) and `le` (less than or equal to) for the quality score.
