# WeaverGen Current Status - Uncommitted Changes

**Time**: Monday, June 30, 2025 Evening
**Branch**: Main (with significant uncommitted changes)
**Status**: 4-Layer Architecture Implementation (Not Committed)

## 🚨 Uncommitted Changes Summary

### Statistics
- **3 Modified Files**: +643 lines of changes
- **15+ New Files**: Complete architecture implementation
- **New Directories**: layers/, agents/, test_generated/

### Major Evolution: 4-Layer Architecture

The project has undergone a significant architectural transformation that hasn't been committed:

```
📁 src/weavergen/layers/         # NEW - Complete 4-layer implementation
   ├── contracts.py              # Layer 4: Data models & interfaces
   ├── runtime.py                # Layer 3: Execution engines
   ├── operations.py             # Layer 2: Business logic
   ├── commands.py               # Layer 1: CLI commands
   ├── otel_validation.py        # OTEL-specific validation
   └── span_gap_validation.py    # Gap analysis tools

📄 src/weavergen/cli.py          # MODIFIED: +622 lines
   └── Rich CLI with multiple subcommands

📄 src/weavergen/agents/          # NEW - Agent implementations
   └── multi_agent_ollama.py     # Ollama-based multi-agent system
```

### CLI Enhancement Details

The CLI has been massively expanded from ~50 to 672+ lines with:

1. **New Commands**:
   - `weavergen generate` - Multi-format code generation
   - `weavergen validate` - Comprehensive validation
   - `weavergen template` - Template management
   - `weavergen semantic` - Semantic convention handling
   - `weavergen status` - Project status checking
   - `weavergen analyze` - Deep project analysis

2. **Rich Interface Features**:
   - Typer integration for better CLI UX
   - Progress bars and spinners
   - Formatted output with Rich
   - Comprehensive error handling

### Architecture Documentation

New documentation files (uncommitted):
- `FOUR_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` - Complete architecture guide
- `OTEL_SPAN_ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION.md` - Span lifecycle validation

## 🎯 Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Commit Decision Required
```bash
# Option A: Review and commit all changes
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: implement 4-layer architecture with enhanced CLI"

# Option B: Selective commit
git add src/weavergen/layers/ && git commit -m "feat: add 4-layer architecture"
git add src/weavergen/cli.py && git commit -m "feat: enhance CLI with multiple commands"

# Option C: Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/4-layer-architecture
git add -A && git commit -m "wip: 4-layer architecture implementation"
```

### 2. Testing Required
- Validate new CLI commands work
- Test layer interactions
- Verify OTEL span validation
- Check multi-agent integration

### 3. Missing Components
- Weaver binary still not installed
- No tests for new architecture
- Documentation needs updating in main README

## 💡 Strategic Recommendation

The uncommitted changes represent a **major architectural leap** for the project. The 4-layer architecture is well-designed and the CLI enhancements are substantial. 

**Recommended approach**:
1. Test the new CLI commands to ensure they work
2. Commit changes to a feature branch for safety
3. Update main documentation to reflect new architecture
4. Finally tackle the Weaver binary installation

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Test new CLI
cd /Users/sac/dev/weavergen
python -m weavergen --help
python -m weavergen status

# Check architecture
python -m weavergen.layers.demo

# Validate changes
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The project has evolved significantly but needs these changes committed and tested before declaring victory on the architecture.
