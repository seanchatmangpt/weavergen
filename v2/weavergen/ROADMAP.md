# Weavergen Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic evolution of Weavergen, focusing on our core competency of declarative orchestration and leveraging the power of OpenTelemetry Weaver Forge. Our approach emphasizes "convention over configuration" and "dogfooding" our own code generation capabilities to deliver a robust, observable, and enterprise-ready platform.

## Strategic Pillars

Weavergen's development is guided by three strategic pillars, each building upon the last to deliver increasing value and market differentiation:

-   **[Phase 1: Foundational Weavergen Architecture](./roadmap/phase_1_foundation.md)**: Establishing the core declarative architecture for automated code generation and basic observability.
-   **[Phase 2: Enterprise-Grade Capabilities](./roadmap/phase_2_enterprise_features.md)**: Enabling advanced enterprise features through declarative code generation and comprehensive observability.
-   **[Phase 3: Market Leadership & Autonomous Evolution](./roadmap/phase_3_market_leadership.md)**: Achieving market leadership through self-optimizing, predictive, and autonomously evolving platform capabilities.

## Core Components & Strategic Allocations

We strategically allocate our efforts across key components, leveraging existing excellence where possible to maximize our unique value proposition:

-   **[Weaver Rust CLI: The High-Performance Code Generation Engine](./roadmap/weaver_rust_cli.md)**: Our foundational engine for high-performance semantic processing and multi-language code generation.
-   **[Pydantic Python: The Type-Safe Backbone of Weavergen](./roadmap/pydantic_python.md)**: Ensuring type safety, data validation, and clean interfaces across all generated code.
-   **[Weavergen Orchestration: Our Core Competency and Unique Value Proposition](./roadmap/weavergen_orchestration.md)**: Our primary focus on intelligent workflow management, enterprise features, and advanced system capabilities.

## Conclusion

Weavergen is committed to delivering a platform that transforms how organizations build and observe their applications. By focusing on declarative orchestration and leveraging best-in-class tools, we aim to provide unparalleled developer productivity, operational efficiency, and a clear path to autonomous system evolution.
