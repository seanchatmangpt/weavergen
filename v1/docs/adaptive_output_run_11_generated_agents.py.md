This Python file defines four Pydantic AI agents: `AnalystAgent`, `CoordinatorAgent`, `ValidatorAgent`, and `FacilitatorAgent`. Each agent is initialized with a mock GPT-4o-mini model and a system prompt defining its role (e.g., "You are an analyst agent specialized in semantic analysis and code generation."). They all have a `process` asynchronous method that takes a dictionary as input and returns a dictionary containing the agent's role, a `processed` flag, the processed output, and a quality score. The `capabilities` attribute for each agent lists its specific analysis role, structured output, and validation. This file demonstrates the structure for dynamically generated AI agents within a Pydantic AI framework.
