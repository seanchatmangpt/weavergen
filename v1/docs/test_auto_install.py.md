This Python file, `test_auto_install.py`, demonstrates and tests the auto-installation feature of the WeaverGen CLI.
It highlights the enhanced CLI's ability to automatically install the correct Weaver binary, making WeaverGen plug-and-play.
The `test_cli_commands` function verifies the functionality of CLI commands like `help`, `doctor`, and `install-weaver` using `subprocess` calls.
`show_enhanced_features` describes the key improvements, including automatic Weaver installation, multiple installation methods (Cargo, direct download), comprehensive health checks, cross-platform support, and force reinstallation.
`show_user_journey` contrasts the "Before (Complex Setup)" with the "After (Plug-and-Play)" experience, emphasizing zero-friction setup.
The `main` function orchestrates these tests and demonstrations, providing a summary of the auto-installation success and available commands.
This script serves as a functional test and a marketing demonstration of WeaverGen's improved user experience regarding dependency management.
