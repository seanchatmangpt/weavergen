This Python file demonstrates a Revolutionary BPMN Engine in an offline, simulated environment.
It showcases AI-native architecture concepts without live AI models.
Key functionalities include Natural Language to BPMN generation, Predictive Execution, Self-Healing Workflows, and Conversational Design.
`SimulatedWorkflow` dataclass represents AI-generated workflows with predicted duration and confidence.
`RevolutionaryBPMNDemo` class simulates AI behaviors for workflow generation, prediction, and optimization.
It uses predefined `workflow_patterns` to simulate AI responses based on user intent.
Demo functions illustrate each capability: `demo_natural_language_generation`, `demo_predictive_execution`, `demo_self_healing`, `demo_conversational_design`, and `demo_ai_insights`.
Error scenarios are simulated to demonstrate self-healing capabilities, including root cause analysis and recovery strategies.
Conversational design is shown through simulated AI-user exchanges for workflow definition.
AI insights and continuous learning are presented through simulated performance metrics and recommendations.
The overall mission is to illustrate a "quantum leap from traditional BPMN" towards AI-driven, self-evolving workflows.
