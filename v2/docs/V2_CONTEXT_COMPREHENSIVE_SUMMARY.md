# WeaverGen v2 Context Comprehensive Summary
*Consolidated Analysis of All v2 Documentation and Architecture*

## Executive Overview

WeaverGen v2 represents a revolutionary transformation from automated code generation to **intelligence-first development partnership**. Built on the proven foundation of v1's span-based validation success (5/5 validation suites passed), v2 introduces artificial intelligence that learns, reasons, and evolves.

## Core Vision & Philosophy

### Intelligence-First Paradigm
- **Multi-Model Orchestra**: First platform to orchestrate multiple AI models for consensus
- **Reasoning Loop Engine**: Iterative improvement with self-correcting AI

### Foundational Principles
1. **Spans Don't Lie**: Every decision backed by execution evidence
2. **Intelligence > Automation**: AI systems that reason, not just generate
3. **Evidence-Based Evolution**: Measurable improvement with every generation
