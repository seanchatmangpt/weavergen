This Python file, `test_real_weaver_unified.py`, is a test script designed to verify the integration of the real OpenTelemetry Weaver Forge binary with the WeaverGen Unified BPMN Engine.
It aims to confirm that the unified engine correctly calls and utilizes the actual Weaver binary for core functionalities, rather than relying solely on simulations.
The `test_real_weaver_integration` asynchronous function performs several tests:
1. **`weaver.initialize`**: Checks if the real Weaver binary can be initialized and its path is correctly identified.
2. **`weaver.validate`**: Attempts to validate a real semantic file (`test_semantic.yaml`) using the actual Weaver validation process.
3. **`weaver.generate`**: Tests real code generation for a specified language (Python) and output directory, verifying the number of generated files.
4. **Full workflow execution**: Runs a complete BPMN workflow (`generate.bpmn`) through the unified engine, then inspects the results to confirm that real Weaver tasks were executed within the workflow.
The script uses `rich` for enhanced console output to provide clear feedback on test results.
It emphasizes that the unified engine now uses the real Weaver binary for core tasks, falls back to simulation when necessary, maintains unified interface benefits, and preserves 100% of original Weaver functionality.
This test is crucial for validating the core promise of WeaverGen: providing a simplified, unified interface while leveraging the full power of the underlying Weaver Forge.
