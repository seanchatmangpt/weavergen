# Phase 2: Enterprise-Grade Capabilities (Next 80/20)

Building upon the foundational architecture, this phase focuses on leveraging Weavergen's declarative code generation to enable advanced enterprise features with minimal manual effort.

### Key Objectives:

-   **ðŸš€ Distributed Execution Orchestration:**
    -   Weavergen will generate BPMN-driven workflows capable of orchestrating distributed tasks across various environments (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless functions).
    -   Generated OpenTelemetry instrumentation will ensure end-to-end trace propagation and context correlation across distributed services, providing full visibility into complex workflows.
    -   The CLI will include commands to trigger and monitor these distributed executions, with all necessary parameters and configurations generated via `weaver-forge.yaml`.

-   **ðŸ§  AI-Powered Optimization Integration:**
    -   Integrate hooks and generated code for AI-driven optimization of workflows and resource allocation.
    -   This includes generating telemetry for key performance indicators (KPIs) that can feed into AI models for predictive analytics and automated adjustments.
    -   Weavergen's generated components will provide the necessary data streams (spans, metrics, logs) for AI systems to analyze and optimize operational efficiency.

-   **ðŸ”’ Enhanced Enterprise Security & Compliance:**
    -   Generate code patterns that enforce security best practices, such as context-aware access control and secure credential handling within generated service tasks.
    -   Leverage OpenTelemetry's baggage and resource attributes to propagate security contexts and compliance metadata across the entire trace.
    -   Automate the generation of audit trails and compliance-related telemetry, ensuring that all critical operations are observable and auditable.

-   **ðŸ“Š Advanced Process Mining & Analytics:**
    -   Weavergen will generate BPMN workflows that are inherently instrumented for process mining, capturing detailed event logs and timestamps.
    -   Leverage OpenTelemetry spans and events to provide granular data for process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis.
    -   The generated CLI will include commands to extract and visualize process data, enabling continuous improvement and bottleneck identification within enterprise workflows.
