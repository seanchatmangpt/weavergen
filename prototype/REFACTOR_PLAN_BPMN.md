# Weaver Forge Prototype: BPMN Refactor Plan

## Executive Summary

This BPMN-style refactor plan outlines the transformation of the Weaver Forge Prototype from its current working state to an enhanced semantic quine system where **everything goes through Spiff** - the semantic convention processing system.

**Current State**: Working semantic quine with 4-layer architecture, basic span instrumentation, and partial CLI integration
**Target State**: Complete semantic quine system where all operations, CLI commands, and code generation are forced through Spiff semantic conventions

## Conclusion

This BPMN refactor plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming the Weaver Forge Prototype from its current working state to a fully enhanced semantic quine system where **everything goes through Spiff**. The plan emphasizes:

1. **Spiff-Only Architecture**: All operations forced through Spiff semantic conventions
2. **Spiff-Controlled CLI Integration**: Complete command generation and user experience through Spiff
3. **Spiff-Driven Self-Regeneration**: Robust semantic quine capabilities controlled by Spiff
4. **Spiff-Enforced Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation and testing through Spiff
5. **Spiff-Centric Development**: Building on existing Spiff integration with complete migration

The implementation follows a phased approach with clear success criteria, risk mitigation strategies, and resource requirements. The result will be a production-ready semantic quine system that demonstrates the viability of Spiff-driven development with full observability.

*"The Spiff-controlled semantic quine demonstrates that semantic conventions, code generation, and observability can be unified from the same semantic source through Spiff - they're only separate due to human cognitive limitations, not architectural necessity."*
