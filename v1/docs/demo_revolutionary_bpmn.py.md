This Python file demonstrates the Revolutionary BPMN Engine, showcasing its AI-native capabilities.
It highlights natural language to BPMN generation, predictive execution, self-healing workflows, and conversational design.
The demo uses `RevolutionaryBPMNEngine` from `src.weavergen.revolutionary_bpmn_engine`.
`demo_natural_language_generation` illustrates creating BPMN from text descriptions and requirements.
`demo_predictive_execution` shows AI forecasting workflow outcomes based on different contexts.
`demo_self_healing` simulates automatic error recovery and workflow modification.
`demo_conversational_design` presents interactive, AI-assisted workflow creation.
`demo_ai_insights` provides simulated AI learning and optimization recommendations.
The file emphasizes the "future of BPMN workflow generation" through AI-driven automation and intelligence.
It uses `rich` for enhanced console output and `asyncio` for asynchronous operations.
