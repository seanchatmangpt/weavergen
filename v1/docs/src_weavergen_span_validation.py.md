This Python file implements a Span-Based Validation system for WeaverGen.
It explicitly states that it uses OpenTelemetry spans for validation and does not rely on Pytest.
`SpanBasedValidator` class manages the creation, tracking, and saving of spans.
`validate_implementation` method validates the syntax of Python files by attempting to compile them and records the results in spans.
`validate_generation_pipeline` method simulates and validates the end-to-end code generation pipeline, including parsing, model generation, and output validation steps.
It uses internal helper methods (`_validate_parsing_step`, `_validate_generation_step`, `_validate_output_step`) which are currently mock implementations but represent distinct stages of the pipeline.
`_start_span` and `_end_span` methods are used to create and manage OpenTelemetry-like spans, capturing `span_id`, `trace_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration_ms`, and `attributes`.
`save_validation_spans` method writes the collected span data to a JSON file.
This module is crucial for the 80/20 implementation strategy, providing a mechanism to verify system behavior and correctness through observable runtime traces rather than traditional unit tests.
