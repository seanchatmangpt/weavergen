This Python file, `demo_unified_architecture.py`, serves as a comprehensive demonstration of WeaverGen's unified BPMN architecture.
It highlights the "80/20 implementation complete" philosophy, emphasizing that all functionality is preserved while achieving 80% easier usability.
The `demo_unified_architecture` asynchronous function orchestrates a series of sub-demonstrations:
1. **Architecture Overview**: Presents a table comparing the complexity of components "Before (Complex)" and "After (Unified)", showcasing the simplification achieved.
2. **Task Discovery & Catalog**: Demonstrates the self-documenting nature of service tasks and the ability to search and categorize them.
3. **Workflow Execution**: Executes a sample AI-enhanced generation workflow and displays its execution summary and a timeline excerpt.
4. **Visual Studio Tools**: Previews the capabilities of the conceptual visual workflow studio, including drag-drop design, interactive debugging, and performance analytics.
5. **Monitoring & Analytics**: Shows performance analysis of executed workflows, including task performance and monitoring features.
6. **Simplified CLI Interface**: Illustrates the streamlined CLI with a table of four core commands that replace numerous complex ones.
7. **Success Summary**: Provides a final summary emphasizing the philosophical achievement of preserving value while removing friction.
The file also includes an `interactive_demo` function, allowing users to choose which aspect of the unified architecture they want to explore.
This script is a powerful tool for showcasing WeaverGen's value proposition and the benefits of its unified design.
