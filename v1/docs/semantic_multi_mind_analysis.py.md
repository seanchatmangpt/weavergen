This Python file, `semantic_multi_mind_analysis.py`, implements a "Semantic Multi-Mind Analysis" system for OpenTelemetry semantic conventions within WeaverGen.
It launches multiple parallel "specialists" (simulated AI agents) to analyze semantic conventions from various perspectives and generate actionable implementation plans for WeaverGen's 4-layer architecture.
The `SemanticMultiMind` class orchestrates this multi-specialist analysis across three phases:
1. **Semantic Convention Analysis**: Five parallel specialists (`_semantic_convention_expert`, `_code_generation_architect`, `_validation_engineer`, `_api_design_specialist`, `_performance_optimization_expert`) analyze the convention's structure, requirements, and potential.
2. **Architecture Integration**: Two specialists (`_layer_integration_specialist`, `_weaver_integration_planner`) focus on how the semantic convention will integrate into WeaverGen's 4-layer architecture (contracts, runtime, operations, commands) and with the Weaver Forge binary.
3. **Implementation Strategy**: An `_implementation_coordinator` synthesizes findings from all specialists to create a comprehensive implementation roadmap.
Each specialist generates `SpecialistAnalysis` objects containing findings, recommendations, implementation steps, and risks.
The system loads or creates a `SemanticConvention` object for analysis.
Finally, it generates a comprehensive JSON report (`semantic_multi_mind_report_{analysis_id}.json`) summarizing the analysis, findings, and implementation roadmap.
This module embodies a sophisticated AI-driven approach to software engineering, where multiple AI perspectives are leveraged to design and plan complex system implementations.
