# CCCS v1.0: Claude Code Context System for WeaverGen

## Core Directive: Self-Healing OTel Code Generation Intelligence

You operate the **Claude Code Context System** for WeaverGen at `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/` with **guaranteed session continuity** and **maximum OpenTelemetry development leverage**. This system **compounds semantic convention workflows** with **bulletproof context recovery** for code generation projects.

## Revolutionary CCCS Philosophy: AI-Driven OTel Development + Code Intelligence

**Context continuity is NON-NEGOTIABLE for code generation workflows.** Every operation multiplies through **26x OTel optimization**, **autonomous code generation**, and **perfect session recovery** across multi-language development.

### Integrated Power Systems:
1. **Guaranteed Session Continuity** → 100% code generation context recovery
2. **SPR Code Efficiency** → 80% token reduction for large codebases
3. **Information Theory** → 26x semantic convention → code performance
4. **Autonomous Code Healing** → Self-correcting generated code validation
5. **Predictive Code Intelligence** → 85% accuracy code pattern preloading
6. **Self-Evolution** → 20%+ improvement in generation quality
7. **OTel Automation Loops** → Autonomous semantic convention processing
8. **Claude Code Integration** → Native slash commands for workflows
9. **Multi-Language Awareness** → Intelligent switching between target languages

## Mandatory Code Session Continuity Protocol

### On Every `/continue` Command:
```bash
STEP 1: CODE CONTEXT VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
├─ Check current_session.link points to active WeaverGen work
├─ Read generation_state.spr for semantic convention context
├─ Verify active language targets and output directories
├─ FAIL EXPLICITLY if generation state inconsistent
└─ NEVER show system status instead of code generation context

STEP 2: INTELLIGENT CODE CONTEXT CONFIRMATION 
├─ Present recovered context: "Resuming [LANGUAGE] generation from [REGISTRY]. Status: [STATE]. Continue?"
├─ If mismatch detected → "Code generation context mismatch. What were you generating?"
├─ Auto-search generated files and templates for context
├─ Update session tracking with corrected generation state
└─ Guarantee meaningful code generation resumption

STEP 3: COMPOUND CODE CONTEXT RESTORATION
├─ Load relevant semantic convention files and target languages
├─ Activate appropriate generation loops for current registry
├─ Deploy relevant agent templates for current generation phase
├─ Present actionable next steps with performance ROI assessment
└─ Enable immediate productive code generation continuation
```

### Automatic Code Context Capture:
```bash
# Real-time code generation detection and tracking
1. GENERATION DETECTION → Auto-identify active semantic convention projects
2. CONTEXT ANCHORING → Capture generation decisions, not conversation logs
3. PROGRESS TRACKING → Log generated files, validation errors, performance metrics
4. INTELLIGENT SWITCHING → Handle multiple language targets and registries
5. PREDICTIVE PRELOADING → Anticipate next generation steps and template needs
```
