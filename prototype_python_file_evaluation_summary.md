# Prototype Python File Evaluation Summary

This document provides a concise evaluation of each Python file found in the `prototype/` directory, categorizing its value based on the project's current architecture and historical context as outlined in `GEMINI.md`.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/example_model_usage.py`

*   **Category:** Historical/Reference Python Script (Review for Archiving).
*   **Reasoning:** This script is a direct Python execution demonstrating model usage from a previous phase, superseded by the current CLI-first, BPMN-driven architecture. It retains value as a historical reference.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/complete_pydantic_models.py`

*   **Category:** Historical/Reference Python Script (Review for Archiving/Deletion).
*   **Reasoning:** This file contains Pydantic models that, according to `GEMINI.md`, should ideally reside in `src/weavergen/models.py`. It likely represents a generated snapshot from a previous development phase. Its direct utility in the current CLI-first, BPMN-driven architecture is minimal. It should be compared against `src/weavergen/models.py` to determine if its contents have been fully superseded. If so, it can be archived or deleted.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/cleanup_generated.py`

*   **Category:** Utility Script (Review for Deletion).
*   **Reasoning:** This script serves a practical and necessary maintenance function for the `prototype` directory, which is explicitly designated for historical and debugging purposes. Its internal lists also offer valuable insights into the project's development history. However, its functionality can be easily replicated by manual shell commands or a more centralized cleanup process.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/validate_cli.py`

*   **Category:** Historical/Reference Python Script (Keep for Debugging/Historical Context).
*   **Reasoning:** While not used for validating the current `weavergen` CLI, it is an essential tool for understanding, testing, and potentially debugging the `prototype_cli.py`. It provides valuable historical insight into the prototype's functionality and testing methodology.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/prototype_cli.py`

*   **Category:** Historical/Reference Python Script (Keep for Debugging/Historical Context).
*   **Reasoning:** This is the main entry point and orchestrator for the entire prototype CLI. It's crucial for understanding the prototype's design, functionality, and how its various components interacted. It's a prime example of a script that should be kept for "understanding historical development" and "debugging" purposes, as explicitly allowed by `GEMINI.md`.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/generate_complete_models.py`

*   **Category:** Historical/Reference Python Script (Review for Archiving).
*   **Reasoning:** This script automates the generation of Pydantic models for the prototype. While the current `weavergen` CLI handles generation via BPMN workflows, this script provides insight into the direct `weaver` CLI usage during the prototype phase. It's a good candidate for archiving once its historical and debugging value is fully understood and if its functionality is completely replicated by the current system.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/otel_communication_roberts.py`

*   **Category:** Historical/Reference Python Script (Keep for Debugging/Historical Context/Demonstration).

*   **Reasoning:** This script is a specialized benchmark for Ollama with Metal GPU acceleration. It's valuable for performance analysis and understanding the LLM integration's hardware dependencies. It fits the "specific isolated testing" and "historical development" criteria for the `prototype` directory. However, its specific focus might make it less universally relevant than core demonstrations.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/ollama_gpu_benchmark.py`

*   **Category:** Historical/Reference Python Script (Review for Archiving).
*   **Reasoning:** This script is a performance benchmark for Ollama, similar to `ollama_metal_benchmark.py`. While it provides valuable insights into LLM performance on specific hardware, it might be superseded by the more comprehensive `ollama_metal_benchmark.py`. It's a good candidate for archiving if its functionality is fully covered by other, more current benchmarks, or if its historical value is deemed less significant.

---

### `/Users/sac/dev/weavergen/prototype/ollama_benchmark_scrum.py`

*   **Category:** Historical/Reference Python Script (Keep for Detailed Performance Benchmarking/Historical Context/Demonstration).
