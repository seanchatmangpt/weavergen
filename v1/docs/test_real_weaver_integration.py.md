This Python file, `test_real_weaver_integration.py`, is a test script that validates the integration of the real OpenTelemetry Weaver Forge binary with the WeaverGen Unified BPMN Engine.
Its primary mission is to confirm that the unified engine can effectively leverage the actual Weaver binary for core operations, ensuring no loss of functionality despite a simplified interface.
The script performs three main tests:
1. **Core WeaverGen Functionality**: Verifies basic operations like `WeaverGen` initialization and semantic registry validation using a dynamically created test semantic file.
2. **Real Code Generation**: Executes an actual code generation process with a real semantic convention, confirming successful file output.
3. **Unified Engine Interaction with Real Weaver**: Assesses if the `UnifiedBPMNEngine` can directly invoke and receive results from real Weaver tasks (e.g., `weaver.initialize`).
The file also includes a `create_real_weaver_integration` function that provides a code example for integrating real Weaver calls into the unified engine.
This script serves as a crucial validation point for WeaverGen's "80/20" philosophy, demonstrating that the system delivers significant usability improvements while preserving 100% of the underlying Weaver Forge's power.
