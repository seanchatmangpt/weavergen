# Lean Six Sigma Project Charter - WeaverGen v2.0

## Project Title: WeaverGen v2.0 - Enterprise-Grade BPMN-Driven Code Generation Platform

**Project Start Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Target Completion:** Q3 2025 (90 days)  
**Project Sponsor:** Engineering Leadership  
**Project Champion:** IndyDevDan  
**Process Owner:** WeaverGen Development Team

## 1. Business Case & Problem Statement

### Current State Problems (Define Phase)
- **70% Functional** - Missing 30% core capabilities due to Weaver dependency
- **Technical Debt** - 161 files with multiple competing implementations
- **No Production Path** - Missing CI/CD, containerization, deployment strategy  
- **Unverified Claims** - 26x performance, 95.2% success rate not measured
- **Code Confusion** - Multiple CLI versions, duplicate functionality
- **Architecture Gap** - BPMN concepts designed but not fully implemented

### Business Impact
- **Developer Time Waste**: 15-20 hours/month navigating confused codebase
- **Integration Delays**: Cannot deploy to production environments
- **Quality Risk**: No automated testing or validation metrics
- **Adoption Barriers**: Complex setup prevents enterprise adoption
- **ROI Loss**: Claimed 30-50 hour savings not being realized

### Opportunity Statement
Transform WeaverGen from a 70% prototype into a production-ready platform that delivers verifiable 30+ hour monthly time savings through BPMN-driven code generation with measurable quality metrics.
