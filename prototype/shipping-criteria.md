# When to Stop Iterating and Ship

## The Fundamental Question

> "If the system can always improve itself, when do we actually ship?"

This is the paradox of self-improving systems. Here's how to resolve it.

## The Shipping Decision Framework

### 🚀 Ship Immediately When:

1. **Core Operations Work**
   ```python
   if semantic_coverage("core_user_journeys") > 0.8:
       ship()
   ```

2. **Contracts Are Satisfied**
   ```python
   if contract_violation_rate < 0.001:  # 0.1% threshold
       ship()
   ```

3. **Telemetry Proves Function**
   ```python
   if observable_success_rate > 0.99:
       ship()
   ```

### 🔄 Keep Iterating When:

1. **Semantic Gaps Exist**
   - Users need operations you haven't modeled
   - Core functionality lacks semantic definition

2. **Generation Fails**
   - Valid semantics produce invalid code
   - Templates have unhandled edge cases

3. **Contracts Frequently Fail**
   - Violation rate > 1%
   - Same violations repeat

## The 1-2-3 Shipping Rule

### 1️⃣ One Core Semantic Model
Define semantics for your PRIMARY use case completely.

**Example**: For a cache service
```yaml
groups:
  - id: cache.get
  - id: cache.set
  - id: cache.delete
  - id: cache.stats
```

**NOT NEEDED**: Edge cases like cache warming, complex eviction policies

### 2️⃣ Two Successful Self-Generations
The system must successfully generate itself TWICE:
1. **Bootstrap**: Initial generation from semantics
2. **Self-Improvement**: Generate enhanced version from telemetry

If both work, the recursive loop is proven.

### 3️⃣ Three Days of Stable Telemetry
Run the system for 3 days:
- Day 1: Identify critical issues
- Day 2: Verify fixes work
- Day 3: Confirm stability

If no semantic changes needed by day 3, ship.

## Red Flags That You're Over-Iterating

### 🚩 The "Just One More Attribute" Syndrome
```yaml
# Version 1
attributes:
  - id: user.email
  - id: user.name

# Version 17 (STOP!)
attributes:
  - id: user.email
  - id: user.email.normalized
  - id: user.email.domain
  - id: user.email.is_corporate
  - id: user.email.spam_score
  # ... 50 more attributes
```

### 🚩 The Telemetry Perfectionism
```python
# Tracking everything
span.set_attribute("loop_iteration", i)
span.set_attribute("memory_before", mem)
span.set_attribute("cpu_temp", temp)
# STOP! You're not debugging, you're shipping
```

### 🚩 The Evolution Addiction
```
v1.0.0 → v1.0.1 → v1.0.2 → ... → v1.0.847
# All in one week? You're addicted to evolution!
```

## The Shipping Checklist

### Semantic Layer ✓
- [ ] Core operations defined
- [ ] Attributes cover main use cases
- [ ] Validation passes

### Generation Layer ✓
- [ ] Templates generate valid code
- [ ] Generated code runs
- [ ] Self-generation works

### Observation Layer ✓
- [ ] Operations emit telemetry
- [ ] Success/failure observable
- [ ] Performance measurable

### Evolution Layer ✓
- [ ] Can generate improvements
- [ ] Has improved once successfully
- [ ] Can rollback if needed

**If all checked: SHIP IT!**

## The 80/20 Shipping Strategy

### Ship at 80% to Get:
- Real user feedback
- Production telemetry data
- Actual vs theoretical problems

### Use Evolution for the 20%:
- Edge cases discovered in production
- Performance optimizations
- Feature additions

## Post-Ship Evolution Criteria

### Evolve When Telemetry Shows:
```python
# Clear evidence of need
error_rate > threshold
latency_p99 > sla
specific_errors > 10_per_day
```

### DON'T Evolve Just Because:
```python
# Bad reasons
days_since_last_evolution > 7  # ❌
competitor_added_feature       # ❌  
architect_has_opinion         # ❌
```

## The Semantic Shipping Manifesto

> Ship when the system proves it works, not when it's perfect.
> 
> Ship when core semantics are stable, not when all edge cases are covered.
> 
> Ship when telemetry shows success, not when tests pass.
> 
> Ship when evolution is possible, not when it's necessary.

## Final Wisdom

**The perfect semantic system that never ships helps no one.**

**The good-enough semantic system in production helps everyone.**

Remember: You're not shipping code, you're shipping **the ability to generate correct code**. Once that ability is proven, ship it.

## The One-Line Test

Ask yourself:

> "Will waiting another day provide evidence that changes my semantic model?"

If NO → Ship today.

If YES → Wait one day, then ask again.

If MAYBE → Ship and let production telemetry answer.

**Ship semantic systems when they work, not when they're perfect. Evolution handles perfection.**
