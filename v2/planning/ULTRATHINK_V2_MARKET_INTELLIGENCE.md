    for all users, creating switching costs and competitive moats
    """
    
    def calculate_network_value(self, projects_count):
        # Metcalfe's Law adaptation for intelligence networks
        base_intelligence = 0.8  # 80% baseline capability
        network_multiplier = 1 + (projects_count * 0.001)  # 0.1% improvement per project
        
        return min(base_intelligence * network_multiplier, 0.98)  # Cap at 98%
    
    async def demonstrate_network_effects(self):
        # Show how 1000+ projects improve individual project outcomes
        return NetworkEffectsDemonstration(
