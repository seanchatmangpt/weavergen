This Python file, `test_final_integration.py`, serves as a final integration test for WeaverGen.
It aims to demonstrate that the 80/20 implementation successfully preserves all Weaver Forge functionality while making it 80% easier to use.
The `test_end_to_end_integration` function verifies the integration by:
1. Testing real Weaver initialization.
2. Validating a registry using the Weaver binary.
3. Executing a unified workflow that combines real Weaver functionality with simulated AI tasks.
It checks if real Weaver tasks are executed and identifies simulated tasks.
The `demonstrate_80_20_success` function presents a table of "Implementation Success Verification" metrics.
These metrics highlight the successful integration of real Weaver functionality, a unified interface, self-documenting tasks, visual monitoring, and a simplified CLI.
The file emphasizes the philosophical success of preserving 100% of functionality while achieving 80% easier usability.
It concludes by confirming that Weaver Forge generation still works within the unified architecture.
This script acts as a comprehensive validation and demonstration of WeaverGen's core value proposition.
