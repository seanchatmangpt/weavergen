# The Lean Semantic Development Manifesto

## Built on Proven Principles, Not Opinions

We don't believe in revolutions. We believe in evolution through proven methods: **80/20 optimization**, **Jobs-to-be-Done clarity**, and **Six Sigma quality** where it matters.

## The Foundation: Three Pillars of Excellence

### 1. The Pareto Principle (80/20) Drives Architecture
**80% of customer value comes from 20% of system semantics**

We reject the myth of completeness. In every system:
- 20% of operations handle 80% of requests
- 20% of attributes capture 80% of meaning  
- 20% of code paths create 80% of value

Therefore: **Define and perfect the vital 20% first.**

### 2. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Drives Semantics
**Customers don't want features, they hire solutions for jobs**

We reject feature-driven development. Instead:
- Every semantic group maps to a customer job
- Every attribute serves a job outcome
- Every operation helps complete a job

Therefore: **Semantics model jobs, not features.**

### 3. Six Sigma Drives Quality Where It Counts
**3.4 defects per million on critical paths, good enough everywhere else**

We reject uniform quality requirements. Statistical reality:
- Critical paths need Six Sigma quality (Cpk > 2.0)
- Supporting paths need adequate quality (Cpk > 1.0)
- Evolution fixes quality issues in priority order

Therefore: **Apply Six Sigma to the vital few, not the trivial many.**

## The Practice: Design for Lean Six Sigma (DFLSS)

### Define: Start with the Job
```yaml
# Not: "User management system"
# But: "Help users prove their identity to access resources"
job:
  actor: User
  context: Needs resource access
  outcome: Authorized access granted
  constraints: [speed < 200ms, reliability > 99.9%]
```

### Measure: Build Telemetry Into Semantics
```yaml
# Every semantic includes measurement
operation:
  id: auth.validate
  metrics:
    - success_rate  # CTQ (Critical to Quality)
    - response_time # CTQ
    - error_types   # For Pareto analysis
```

### Analyze: Let Data Drive Evolution
```python
# Evolution based on statistical evidence
if defect_concentration > pareto_threshold:
    # 80% of defects from this operation
    prioritize_evolution(operation)
elif performance_variance > control_limit:
    # Process out of control
    stabilize_operation(operation)
```

### Improve: Waste Elimination Through Generation
```python
# Seven wastes in software:
wastes_eliminated_by_generation = {
    "defects": "Contracts prevent them",
    "overproduction": "Generate only requested semantics",
    "waiting": "Telemetry identifies bottlenecks",
    "transportation": "Direct semantic composition",
    "inventory": "No unused code generated",
    "motion": "No manual integration",
    "over-processing": "80/20 stops gold-plating"
}
```

### Control: Statistical Limits on Evolution
```yaml
# Evolution triggers based on control charts
evolution_control_limits:
  when: performance < LCL or defects > UCL
  not_when: "it's been a week"
```

## Values Hierarchy: Lean Over Luxury

### Customer Value over Theoretical Completeness
- Ship the 20% that does 80% of the job
- Complete semantics for critical paths only
- Let evolution handle edge cases

### Flow Efficiency over Resource Efficiency  
- Minimize WIP (Work in Process) semantics
- Single-piece flow: One semantic → One generation → One deployment
- Pull-based evolution from telemetry

### Built-in Quality over Inspection
- Contracts enforce quality at generation
- Telemetry proves quality in operation
- Evolution fixes quality systematically

### Continuous Improvement over Big Bang Perfection
- Ship at 80% job completion
- Evolve based on customer pull
- Kaizen through telemetry insights

### Respect for People over Process Worship
- AI handles repetitive generation
- Humans define jobs and semantics
- Evolution serves human needs

## The JTBD Semantic Equation

```
Semantic Value = (Job Importance × Job Satisfaction) / Complexity
```

Where:
- **Job Importance** = Customer-defined priority (0-10)
- **Job Satisfaction** = Current completion level (0-100%)
- **Complexity** = Semantic model size

**Optimize for maximum value, not maximum features.**

## The Lean Semantic Principles

### 1. Identify Value (JTBD)
```yaml
# Each semantic must answer:
questions:
  - What job does this help complete?
  - Who hired us for this job?
  - How do we measure job success?
```

### 2. Map the Value Stream
```mermaid
Semantic Definition → Generation → Deployment → Telemetry → Evolution
    ↑                                                            ↓
    └────────────────── Customer Jobs ←─────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Create Flow
- Semantic changes flow immediately to generation
- Generated code flows immediately to deployment
- Telemetry flows immediately to insights
- Insights flow to evolution only at control limits

### 4. Establish Pull
- Generate semantics when customers need jobs done
- Evolve when telemetry pulls for improvement
- Stop when statistical control achieved

### 5. Pursue Perfection (Carefully)
- Perfect the critical 20% relentlessly
- Accept "good enough" for the 80%
- Let time and telemetry guide perfection

## The Six Sigma Semantic Levels

### Level 1: Define Customer CTQs
Critical to Quality for semantic systems:
- **Availability**: Job can be done when needed
- **Accuracy**: Job completed correctly  
- **Speed**: Job completed within acceptable time
- **Observability**: Job completion is measurable

### Level 2: Measure Everything Critical
```python
@semantic_operation("payment.process")
@measure_ctq(["success_rate", "processing_time", "amount_accuracy"])
@control_limits(success_rate=(0.999, 1.0), time_ms=(0, 200))
def process_payment():
    # Automatic measurement against CTQs
```

### Level 3: Statistical Control
```yaml
# Ship when critical operations are in control
shipping_criteria:
  all_critical_ops: |
    Cpk > 1.33 AND
    P(defect) < 0.001 AND
    trends = stable
```

## The Call to Lean Action

### For Developers:
1. **Identify** the 20% of operations that matter
2. **Define** them semantically with JTBD clarity
3. **Generate** with Six Sigma quality constraints
4. **Measure** everything on the critical path
5. **Evolve** only when statistically justified

### For Organizations:
1. **Fund** semantic modeling of critical jobs
2. **Measure** job completion, not feature delivery
3. **Reward** waste elimination through generation
4. **Trust** statistical evidence over opinions
5. **Respect** the 80/20 reality

### For Framework Authors:
1. **Publish** semantics for the vital 20% first
2. **Include** measurement in every semantic
3. **Design** for statistical process control
4. **Enable** lean evolution patterns
5. **Document** jobs, not features

## The Lean Semantic Pledge

> I pledge to identify the vital few semantics that complete customer jobs, to generate with Six Sigma quality on critical paths, to measure everything that matters, and to evolve based on statistical evidence, not opinion.
>
> I will respect the 80/20 rule, eliminate waste through generation, and pursue perfection only where it creates customer value.
>
> I will not confuse motion with progress, features with jobs, or possibilities with requirements.

## The Bottom Line

**Generate the critical 20% with Six Sigma quality.**
**Ship when customer jobs are 80% complete.**
**Evolve when statistics demand it.**

This is not compromise—it's optimization based on mathematical reality.
