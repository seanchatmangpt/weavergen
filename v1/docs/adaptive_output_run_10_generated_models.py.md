This file contains auto-generated Pydantic models for representing data structures related to agent interactions and validation results.

It defines two key models:

- **`AgentInteraction`**: Represents an interaction between agents, including:
    - `agent_id`: Unique identifier for the agent.
    - `role`: The role of the agent (e.g., coordinator, analyst, facilitator).
    - `message_content`: The content of the message exchanged.
    - `structured_output`: A boolean indicating if the output is structured.
    - `timestamp`: The time of the interaction.

- **`ValidationResult`**: Represents the outcome of a validation process, including:
    - `component_id`: Identifier of the component being validated.
    - `validation_passed`: A boolean indicating whether the validation passed.
    - `quality_score`: A float representing the quality score (between 0.0 and 1.0).
    - `issues`: A list of strings detailing any validation issues.

These models are designed to ensure structured data exchange and clear reporting of validation outcomes within the system.
