## 🚧 RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** SpiffWorkflow performance at scale  
**Mitigation:** Implement workflow caching and parallel execution optimization  
**Contingency:** Fall back to direct function calls with span capture  

**Risk:** Pydantic AI rate limits or API failures  
**Mitigation:** Implement intelligent retry logic and fallback to cached results  
**Contingency:** Disable AI features gracefully with warning messages  

**Risk:** Weaver binary compatibility issues across versions  
**Mitigation:** Pin specific Weaver version and test against multiple versions  
**Contingency:** Provide manual Weaver installation instructions  

### Timeline Risks

**Risk:** AI integration taking longer than expected  
**Mitigation:** Implement AI features incrementally, starting with registry analysis  
**Contingency:** Release v2.0 without AI, add AI in v2.1  

**Risk:** BPMN workflow complexity causing delays  
**Mitigation:** Start with simple workflows, add complexity incrementally  
**Contingency:** Simplify workflows and add advanced features in later releases  

### Quality Risks

**Risk:** Span-based validation not catching all issues  
**Mitigation:** Implement multiple validation layers (span + integration + manual)  
**Contingency:** Add selective unit tests for critical components
